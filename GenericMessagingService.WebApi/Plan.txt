A generic messaging service for mutliple types of messages
Each message type should support custom configurtaion
The idea is that any project which wants an email/text/notification microservice should be able to take this and configure to handle any needs

Email:
	Emails should be handled via an endpoint which specifies a template, and some data
	Templates should support a multitude of types
		Database: Template strings live in a database table, where the database/table/columns are specified in config.
		Razor: Templates live in a folder structure in the Razor format
	These templates should have sensible defaults, with mixing of types (as a project may use database currently, but we want to migrate to Razor Templates)
	Different email sending strategies should be supported, direct SMTP service, SendGrid etc

SMS:
	SMS will happen using twillio, with basic templating

Push Notification:
	Should support android/ios, using whatever services are needed
