A generic messaging service for mutliple types of messages
Each message type should support custom configurtaion
The idea is that any project which wants an email/text/notification microservice should be able to take this and configure to handle any needs

Email:
	Emails should be handled via an endpoint which specifies a template, and some data
	Different email sending strategies should be supported, direct SMTP service, SendGrid etc

SMS:
	SMS will happen using twillio, with templating

Push Notification:
	Should support android/ios, using whatever services are 

Templating:
	Two seperate parts
	The templates should be able to be stored in multiple places
		- database
		- folder structure
		- remote file store
	The templates should support multiple formats
		- basic string format
		- razor
		- handlebars
